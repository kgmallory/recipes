Ingredients:
 - 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
 - 2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
 - 3 tablespoons sugar
 - 1 tablespoon salt
 - 2 tablespoons canola oil
 - 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
 1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, salt, oil
    and   3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2
    cup at a time, to form a soft dough.
    
 2. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10
    minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and
    let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

 3. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in
    half. Shape each into a loaf. Place in two greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. Cover
    and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes.

 4. Bake at 375° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds
    hollow when tapped. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Yield: 2 loaves
    (16 slices each).
